# Tracking Time
Got an Individual project to clone Tracking Time website. I have completed this project within 4 days.
Tracking Time is a time tracker website, where you can see how much time you spend on each task or project! TrackingTime's integrations make it easy to keep track of your billable and non-billable tasks by integrating with more than 30 apps. Time Tracking will help you improve your time tracking and increase your productivity with these Integrations.

In this project, I have made the following things :
 - Log In Page
 - Navbar
 - Home Page
 - Integration Page
 - Blog Page
 - Footer Page
